# The Software Collective Constitution

## Mission Statement

I, William Outlaw Miller, believe that capitalism is the root of all evil. Companies incentivized by profit are driven to cut wages, fire employees, and contract for the US government to kill children in Palestine. I believe that the only way to remove capitalism is to remove greed. This constitution outlines my vision for a Software Collective, or, a company structured with no job titles, no management layer, no hidden budget and salary negotiations, and no incentive to profit for external shareholders. 

This constitution removes the need for an upper level of power-wielding decision-makers and flattens the structure to two roles, Junior and Senior. This constitution requires the collective to operate with complete financial transparency. This constitution defines procedures and rituals to be followed for budget approval, approval and removal of members, and any other important financial decisions that a company might make.


## Organizational Structure

### Membership Ranks

The collective operates with a simple rank structure:

- **Junior Members**: A junior can be defined by their technical expertise, productivity, independence, and tenure. A junior will be expected to remain a member for at least a year, contribute to multiple projects, learn multiple new skills, and finally, lead a project of their own to release. Once these steps are complete, they may apply for senior membership and be approved with 2/3 vote from all members.

- **Senior Members**: A senior is considered a permanent member of the collective. They are free to choose between revenue sharing and salaried pay, contingent on budget approval as outlined later. Seniors are expected to both contribute and lead projects, move around to fill important roles for any work within the collective, and contribute to the development of juniors.

There are no traditional job titles within the collective. Members are free to work on projects that match their skills and interests, organizing themselves into project groups as needed. 

### Revenue Sharing Model

The collective operates on a revenue-sharing model:

- **Proportional Revenue Sharing**: Senior members have the option to receive proportional revenue sharing based on the collective's total revenue from contracts, software sales, and other income streams.

- **Salaried Positions**: Some members may be hired as salaried employees, but all salaries and raises are completely public and transparent within the collective.

- **Collective Reserve**: The collective company itself reserves a fixed proportional share of revenue for operational costs, upgrades, expansions, speculative investments, and other collective needs that require purchasing power.

### Financial Transparency

All budgeting and salaries are completely public within the collective. This transparency ensures that all members understand how resources are allocated and can participate meaningfully in financial decisions.

## Decision-Making Processes

### Financial Review Meetings

Twice a year, the collective holds a meeting to review finances and approve changes to salaries and revenue sharing. All financial decisions made at these meetings are democratic, requiring a **2/3 majority** to pass.

This high threshold is critical, as any disagreement on the budget could fracture the collective. If members cannot come to an agreement, the collective must initiate a procedure to split into two separate collectives, on the presumption that compromise is no longer possible. The smaller of the voting bloc will be ousted from the original collective and expected to organize into a separate collective on their own.

### Day-to-Day Operations

Regular operational costs and day-to-day financial decisions do not require approval. However, major financial decisions must follow a specific process:

- **Major Financial Decisions**: Purchases over $1,000, new member admissions, and other significant financial commitments must be proposed by a senior member in a public forum.

- **Approval Process**: Major decisions require approval from at least **two additional senior members** of the collective before implementation.

### Member Removal

The goal of the collective is to function as a union of workers, not selectively. Member removal is a serious matter and should be avoided whenever possible. However, removal may be considered for:

- Disorderly behavior that harms the collective
- Consistently poor performance and laziness
- Actions that are more harmful than beneficial to the collective

**Removal Process**:

- A senior member may initiate proceedings to remove another member.
- If removing a **junior member**: Requires approval from **two other senior members**.
- If removing a **senior member**: Requires a **2/3 majority vote** from the entire collective.

All removal proceedings are conducted publicly and transparently, though the sensitive nature of these events requires careful consideration and should be kept to a minimum.

## Collective Activities

Members of the collective engage in various activities:

- **Contract Work**: Members organize themselves into project groups to accept and complete contracts. Contracts are paid out to the collective. The collective will use its bargaining power and pooled resources to have a competitive edge on the contract market.

- **Software Development**: Members develop and release software using collective server resources and talent. Revenue generated from non-contracted work using collective resources will be paid out to the collective, assuming that the collective takes ownership of operational costs and day-to-day operations such as hosting server applications. 

- **Recreation**: Members use collective spaces to host events, classes, workshops, and other community-building activities. The collective should provide clean and accessible recreational spaces.

### Branches

The collective is an outline, not a single company. I, William Outlaw Miller, currently live in Nashville, and I am operating the Nashville branch of the Software Collective. Others might feel inclined to start their own branches of the Software Collective. In the short term, these branches will operate independently, with revenue sharing only extending to their immediate branch. Collectives are free to merge at any time, but care must be taken to maintain the nuanced decision-making that is required with local branches. This means that a new constitution will need to be drafted at that time. 

## Philosophy and Values

The Software Collective is built on the principle that workers should have control over their labor and receive fair compensation for their contributions. We reject the traditional model where bosses hand out money unfairly as they see fit. Instead, we operate with complete transparency and democratic decision-making.

Our structure provides members with:

- **Security**: Protection from arbitrary layoffs or firings at the whim of a boss
- **Fairness**: Proportional benefit from the value you create
- **Autonomy**: Freedom to work on projects that match their skills and interests
- **Community**: A supportive environment where members can grow and thrive together
- **Purpose**: The opportunity to build something meaningful while living a happier, more fulfilling life. FREE FROM CAPITALISM

## Long-Term Vision

The ultimate goal of the Software Collective is to create a new form of union for software developers. By organizing developers into a collective structure where all members benefit proportionally, we create a sustainable alternative to traditional employment models. If many developers are members of the collective, companies must engage with us on our terms, ensuring fair compensation and working conditions for all software professionals.

This vision requires commitment, transparency, and a willingness to prioritize long-term collective benefit over short-term individual gain. It is a radical restructuring of how software development work is organized and compensated, but I, William Outlaw Miller, believe it is necessary to create a more equitable and sustainable industry, and maybe one day the world.
